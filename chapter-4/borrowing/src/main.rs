//A reference is like a pointer in that itâ€™s an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.


//Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value. This code that attempts to create two mutable references to s will fail:

//Filename: src/main.rs

//This code does not compile!
    // let mut s = String::from("hello");
    //invalid
    // let r1 = &mut s;
    // let r2 = &mut s;
    //invalid 
    // let r1 = &s;
    // let r2 = &mut s;

    // println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
    
    //valid
    // let r1 = &s;
    // let r2 = &s;
    
// We also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.

/// hanging reference :O

//fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

   // let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

  //  &s // we return a reference to the String, s
//} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
